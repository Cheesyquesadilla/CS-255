# CS-255

* For this project I was to help design a system for a client, DriverPass, which was meant to help students learning how to driver to pass their test. Users were supposed to login or create a new account, if they weren't already
  set up within the system) and choose which package they wanted to purchase. Each package offered different access to training and study resources and the system would then use the package chosen to adjust who could access what.
  I feel I did best on the business requirements document for this project since it was the part that I best understood.

* I feel that the part of this project that needs revised would be the UML diagrams. I have a hard time making diagrams since I can't seem to find a good middle ground between too much information and not enough. If I would have
  taken more time to lay out what the system would need to do and what all would need to be done when interacting with it then I would have had an easier time.

* When it comes to the designing part of the software I don't really have a process I use. I tend to just throw everything out and see what sticks. In order to do better work I feel I should take more time figuring out what the
 system needs to do when the user is interacting with it and what will be performed on the backend.
